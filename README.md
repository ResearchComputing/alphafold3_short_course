# Alphafold3 (RC Short Course)
AlphaFold3 is an open-source artificial intelligence program that predicts the 3D structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequence. The program and its underlying algorithm solve a long-standing problem in structural biology, so adoption by the research community has been swift and enthusiastic.

Running AlphaFold3 involves a simple json format input file and few parameter specifications, but requires access to large-scale computational resources such as GPUs and enough RAM to perform a search against a collection of datasets. This RC Short Course* will provide an overview of running AlphaFold3 on CU Boulderâ€™s Alpine supercomputer, including how to format input files, submit jobs, and interpret results.

This session is intended for users with experience working in a Linux command-line environment and submitting jobs on Alpine or a similar HPC system. Participants should have a Research Computing Account prior to the start of the training if they wish to try hands-on examples.

_What is an RC Short Course?_ A training that provides an in-depth understanding of a concept, system, or tool. You can expect to leave a "Short Course" with a solid grasp of the topic
